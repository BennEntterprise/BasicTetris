# BasicTetris
This game was created following a tutorial a few years ago, but I would like to add some additional 
features that make this a bit more engaging. 


To Use
Download or clone the git repository. 

Get into the directory 
cd BasicTetris

Install Dependencies
npm install 

Start the Server
npm dev


Playing the Game
Use arrows to move the puzzle piece around. Use "Q" and "W" to rotate the piece. 
Try to stack efficiently, creating a solid row left to right. Each solid row
you create will earn you a point. See how high of a score you can get without letting the blocks 
get to the ceiling!

Happy Playing!
